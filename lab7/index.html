			<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Honestly my problems started with when we started talking about cars haha since I know nothing about them. Besides that it took me a bit to fully understand the purpose of Javascript. Additionally, due to server errors Github has been difficult in allowing me to upload images no matter the size. Things happen, that's all I can say. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Together we worked with decisiveness and efficiency. I like the labels and objects that can be done with javascript as it creates a very readable source of code. Hope it stays like that for the rest of our projects.   </p>
