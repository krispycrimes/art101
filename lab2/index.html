			<h1>Hello World ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა, Goodnight You (ृ ु⁎ᴗᵨᴗ⁎)ु.zZ </h1>
			<p> I'm Kristine and my partner is Sammy! We both love digital art and we're excited to ace this class! Let's go!</p>

					<h2> ✨ Problems </h2>
					<p>At first I was overwhelemed with all the new terms and what each tag meant and the structure of the code. But after looking at the tutorials and Wes' lectures, I was able to break it down into manageable chunks and worked on it one step at a time. Additionally, I needed more time to look into being very specific and aware of the links and names for things in order to create working redirects. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> 🌌 Reflection </h2>
					<p>In this process, I became more comfortable and came to understand the structure of code and what it means. Initally I saw this as a blurb of intimidating text but I'm beginning to see the logic and structure of it all. It's really is like seeing into the magic. Fun!</p>
