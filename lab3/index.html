			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We struggled uploading and resizing the images. Before that we had to figure out that we only needed to use VScode and not the retired text editor called Atom ~ bye bye teletyper :[ ~. For me specically I forgot to include the line seperations to make it a bulleted list initially so it all appeared as one line. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was great working on call with my partner as it really helped us understand the assignment and helped detangle some confusion with the instructions earlier </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
