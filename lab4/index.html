			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our challenges were figuring out how much we needed to break everything down to steps in order to communicate and define fully the task at hand. We were wondering at what level of understanding and assumptions can be made while defining a task and its steps but we assumed that we had to explain it to a robot or an alien who would follow our instructions literally. Minesweeper was an interesting problem as I had vague memories of it and so my lack of familiarity helped with defining the different steps that had to be defined as I find sometimes when something is intuitive to us, we can overlook assumptions we make in the process that isn't immediately obvious to those unfamiliar. On the other hand, because of my lack of familiarity with the game, understanding the mechanics was something I had to learn along the way.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>For this assignment, we worked together to create a list of tasks for baking cookies and for implementing the game Minesweeper. We then put that pseudocode as comments into our javascript file. 

						We faced some challenges trying to break down baking into as simple steps as possible. We started with the basic set of instructions for baking, then continued to break it down into even smaller and simpler steps, imagining we were trying to teach someone who had never baked before. It was also quite difficult figuring out how to approach pseudocoding minesweeper. Although it seemed like a simple game, we quickly realized a lot of the complexities and definitions that had to be established before we could even start the game. We turned to some online resources to understand how Minesweeper usually works, then translated that into pseudo code.

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre><code>
	//Define the three cell states
		//An unopened cell is blank 
		//An opened cell displays whether it is a ‘mine cell’ or a ‘non-mine cell’
			//An unopened cell can become an opened cell by left clicking on it
			//If it is a “non-mine cell’, the open cell will then display a number indicating how many mines are diagonal or adjacent to it 
		//A flagged cell covers an unopened cell with an image of a flag
			//An unopened cell can become a flagged cell by right clicking on it
			//A flagged cell can be converted back to an unopened cell by right clicking on it
	//Define lose condition
		//If the player opens a ‘mine cell’
	//Define win condition
		//If all the ‘non-mine cells’ are opened cells and all the ‘mine cells’ are unopened or flagged cells
	//Set up the board
		//Generate a game board of 8x8 cells
		//Randomly select 10 tiles to be designated as ‘mine cells’
		//The remaining 54 tiles are designated as ‘non-mine cells’
		//Start the game with all 64 cells being unopened cells 
	//Start timer from 00:00 
	//In the corner, keep track of and display ‘flag number’
		//The flag number starts at 10
		//Everytime an unopened cell is converted to a flagged cell, subtract 1 from the flag number
		//If flag cell is removed, add one to the flag number 
	//Accept user input 
	//After each user input, check for lose or win condition
		//If lose condition is met, replace the revealed mine tile with an explosion tile. Starting from this tile, replace all adjacent cells with explosion tiles until all tiles are explosion tiles
		//If win condition is met, play animation of confetti bursting
		//If lose or win condition is met, stop timer and display final timer number
		//If lose or win condition is met, display a button with the text ‘new game?’
			//If ‘new game’ button is clicked with the left mouse button, restart the code procedure
