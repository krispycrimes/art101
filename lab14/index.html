					<h2>Problems/Debugging</h2>
					<p> Going back and debugging it was a doozy. The CSS properties for the bubbles were improperly nestled and missing some brackets. I do thank chatgpt for helping me generate 50 random values for each bubble animation but it's such a chunky piece of code I wonder if there's a way not to make it look so awful. Another change was moving the html "Make special" button to just appear solely through js so that we don't get double instances of the "Make Special Button" Additionally, now that I have an easier method to embedded images I was finally able to get the bathroom tile background that I wanted. While I'm uncertain of how efficently the original author coded the bubble generation, I do see how the css, js, and html are all linked. The html div bubbles creates these instances while the css is what moves each one in a parent-child relationship..</p>
